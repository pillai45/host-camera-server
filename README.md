# VHAL Client library 

libvhal-client is a library written in C++17 for Touch, Joystick, GPS, Camera, Audio and Sensor modules. Currently only Camera is
supported. Using this library, a client can interact with Camera Vhal without worrying about socket connection,
data structure, command details. Instead, the library exposes simple and powerful API that simplifies the life of
VHAL client modules such as CG-Proxy, Streamer, etc. Any internal changes in the Camera VHAL and the library
is abstracted and hence it wonâ€™t affect client code. New features or improvements can be provided via APIs
rather than new socket commands, and other details.

### To install/copy libvhal-clinet.so in to destination directory
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<Absolute path to install>
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=<Relative directory name to install libs>
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR=<Relative directory name to install bins> ..

Example:
libvhal-client$mkdir build
libvhal-client$cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$(pwd)/..
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR=lib ..
libvhal-client$make
libvhal-client$make install
```
## Camera

Camera VHal runs socket server (UNIX, VSock are supported). VHAL Client library shall connect to socket server path or address/port endpoint.

### Architecture
![image](https://github.com/intel-sandbox/libvhal-client/assets/26615772/66a89e80-d316-11eb-814f-c4e75902441c)

### Steps to interact with libVHAL-Client from Streamer

1. Create an object to libVHAL's `vhal::client::VideoSink` by passing `vhal::client::UnixConnectionInfo`.
Then libVHAL will prepare and connect to Camera server using UNIX domain sockets.
```cpp
    UnixConnectionInfo conn_info = { socket_path, instance_id };
    try {
        video_sink = make_shared<VideoSink>(conn_info);
    }
```

2. Register a callback with `vhal::client::VideoSink` for Camera open/close commands.
```cpp
video_sink->RegisterCallback([&](const VideoSink::CtrlMessage& ctrl_msg) {
// Callback Implementation here
}
```

3. Send the camera frames to libVHAL-client as below.
```cpp
video_sink->SendDataPacket(inbuf.data(), inbuf_size);
```

4. For non-encoded data camera frames always of fixed size example I420
   in such cases both vhal and libVHAL-client knows the data size exchange
   in such scenario SendRawPacket will used as below.
```cpp
video_sink->SendRawPacket(inbuf.data(), inbuf_size);
```

Example implementation to interact with libVHAL-client is present in examples/camera_client.cc
